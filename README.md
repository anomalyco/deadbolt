A decentralized password manager, in Rust. Your devices sync directly with each other over [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer); a new device joins only by pairing from one you already have. No accounts, no servers of our own.

Status: design. No code yet.

## Docs

- [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) — **the current v1 design** (two keys, signed membership, per-device encrypted logs, QR pairing).
- `docs/research/` — prior art
  - [`01-inkandswitch.md`](docs/research/01-inkandswitch.md) — Keyhive, BeeKEM, Beelay/Subduction, Automerge
  - [`02-rust-sync-stacks.md`](docs/research/02-rust-sync-stacks.md) — iroh, p2panda, Willow, Loro/Automerge/yrs
  - [`03-mailbox-pairing-keys.md`](docs/research/03-mailbox-pairing-keys.md) — mailboxes (Nostr, S3, folders), pairing, how other password managers handle keys and recovery
- `docs/history/` — how we got here: the v0 proposal, the no-infrastructure (Nostr mailbox) revision, and two adversarial critiques of them. Superseded by `docs/design.md`; kept for the reasoning. These docs reference the research files by bare filename.

## Site

`site/` is the website: a landing page (`/`) and an animated architecture walkthrough (`/architecture/`), in the style of opentunnel.xyz (Vite, React, Motion, WebGL2 prints; fonts are Anton and IBM Plex Mono, OFL, licences in `site/public/fonts/`). `cd site && bun install && bun run dev` serves it on http://127.0.0.1:5197. The original static mock is kept at [`site/mock.html`](site/mock.html).
